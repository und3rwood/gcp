            <li>Taxation is theft, but not if if helps to prevent competition.</li>
            <li>the universe was created 100 years ago by george washington, who was the founder of the Globalist Corporate Party.</li>

            <li>the GCP will pursue genetic engineering techniques in order to pursue the creation of neko-races to be servants of the Party. </li>* 
            <li>the GCP will pursue a Universial Social Credit system.</li>
            <li>our motto: 'prosperity for the few.'</li>
            <li>breaking a contract is grounds for capital punishment.</li>
            <li>the corrupt and ineffective police system will be abolished and replaced with entirely private law enforcement. </li>
            <li>expansionism is unethical, but not if valuable resources are at stake. </li>
            <li>debtors will be given non-optional labor assignments in order to pay their creditors.</li>
            <li>inflation is not real; it's a neoliberal hoax.</li>
            <li>slavery should remain illegal, instead, we will make it impossible to live comfortably without working at LEAST forty hours a week + overtime, year round.</li>
            <li>Citizens will need to obtain a license to:

                <ul>
                    <li>own a knife.</li>
                    <li>own a firearm.</li>
                    <li>own property.</li>
                    <li>get a job.</li>
                    <li>have sexual intercourse.</li>

                    <li>own a vehicle.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>immigrants are ALWAYS welcome (to work for an entirely fair living wage in the agriculture, service, or web development sectors).</li>
            <li>immigration will be controlled through an (entirely humane) Reality TV Show. 1000 immigrants will be dropped into a large swath of texas desert, where they will scavenge for weapons and gear. They will be slowly pushed toward a central point by roving bands of californian death squads. The last 100 immigrants to survive will be allowed to work in the strawberry fields of southern oregon.</li>
            <li> Freedom of Speech is a cornerstone of democracy and can lead to societal reform and increased well-being for many. However, freedom of speech does <em>not</em> mean <strong>freedom from consequences</strong>. Consequently, a citizen that uses their natural right to Freedom of Speech to discuss the following topics will face <strong>consequences:</strong>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Criticism of the CGP.</li>
                    <li>Criticism of strawberry farms</li>
                    <li>Criticism of multinational corporations.</li>
                    <li>Modification of the constitution</li>
                    <li>Illegal substances</li>
                    <li>The Caste System</li>
                    <li>Unapproved Altered states of consciousness</li>
                    <li>Wages</li>
                    <li>Work hours</li>
                    <li>Socially Incorrect political systems</li>
                    <li>Socially Incorrect Literature</li>
            
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Racism will not be tolerated (unless it's economically beneficial). </li>
            <li>pedophilic elites rule the world. This, in fact, is a good thing; the elites do a great of running the world. //TODO: come up with a convincing reason. </li>
            <li>'states' will be replaced with corporations with sovereignty over territory. Corporate states should band together to form trusts in order to protect themselves from uprisings. </li>
            <li>utah will be abolished. </li>
            <li>any form of minimum wage will be prohibited.</li>
            <li>mormons will be deported to epstein's island.</li>

            <li>minimum prices for lifesaving medication will be established.</li>
            <li>cannabalism, live infant sacrifice, and other forms of human flesh consumption is legal.</li>
            <li>disrespect to elders is hate speech and is punishable accordingly.</li> 
            <li>loitering and other forms of homelessness will be criminalized.</li>
            <li>the age of consent will be abolished.</li> 
            <li>before receiving medical care, citizens must choose to pay the cost of the procedure. If they are unable to communicate, they automatically receive treatment, but will have to pay back the (generous) loan they were given, with non-negotiable interest dictated by the lender. </li>
            <li>the standard combat policy of the CGP is to kill as many civilians as possible. This is in order to end conflicts <em>swiftly</em> and <em>efficiently</em>. </li> 
        </ol>
